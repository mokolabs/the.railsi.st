In case you don't subscribe to the [SD Ruby podcast](http://sdruby.org/), we just uploaded a huge batch of fresh episodes.

We've got talks on [ActsAsSolr](http://sdruby.org/podcast/26), [Edge Rails](http://sdruby.org/podcast/33), [Seaside](http://sdruby.org/podcast/31)</a>, [ActiveRecord Backup & Mimetypefu](http://sdruby.org/podcast/35), [JRuby](http://sdruby.org/podcast/34), [AJAX CSS stars](http://sdruby.org/podcast/25), [Amazon SQS](http://sdruby.org/podcast/24), [Capistrano](http://sdruby.org/podcast/32), and more.

There's also a 20 minute talk on [Headliner and Styler](http://sdruby.org/podcast/27) that I gave back in May.

(Sydney RORO members can skip this one... this is the same talk I did in Australia.)
