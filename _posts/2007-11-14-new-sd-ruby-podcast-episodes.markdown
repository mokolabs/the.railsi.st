In case you don't subscribe to the [SD Ruby podcast](http://podcast.sdruby.com/), we just uploaded a huge batch of fresh episodes.

We've got talks on [ActsAsSolr](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-026-acts-as-solr), [Edge Rails](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-033-life-on-edge), [Seaside](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-031-seaside)</a>, [ActiveRecord Backup & Mimetypefu](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-035-activerecord-backup-mimetypefu), [JRuby](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-034-intro-to-jruby), [AJAX CSS stars](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-025-ajax-css-star-rating-with-actsasrateable), [Amazon SQS](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-024-using-ruby-amazon-sqs-to-build-backdoors), [Capistrano](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-032-capistrano), and more.

There's also a 20 minute talk on [Headliner and Styler](http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/2/episode-027-headliner-and-styler) that I gave back in May.

(Sydney RORO members can skip this one... this is the same talk I did in Australia.)
