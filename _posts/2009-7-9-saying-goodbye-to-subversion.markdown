title: Saying goodbye to Subversion
---
My plugins have been [living on Github](http://github.com/mokolabs/) for over a year, so I think it's time to kill off my old Subversion repo.

If you need to reinstall my plugins, use these git-enabled links. (I've also updated their respective pages here.)

{% highlight bash %}
script/plugin install git://github.com/mokolabs/headliner.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/mokolabs/styler.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/mokolabs/javascript.git
{% endhighlight %}

Apologies to anyone who's still using svn. Hopefully, you'll learn the ways of the force soon.
