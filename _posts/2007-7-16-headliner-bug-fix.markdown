title: Headliner bug fix

Thanks to Jason Perry and Richard Crowley for catching a bug in the last Headliner update.

I'm hoping to put together tests for Headliner (and Styler) soon, so releases can be more reliable in the future, especially for people who are using svn externals.

Anyways, the bug is fixed, so I highly recommend updating now.
