<p>SD Ruby just posted "my talk on Haml and Sass":http://podcast.sdruby.com/2007/11/20/episode-038-haml-and-sass-in-15-minutes (given at this month's meeting).</p>

<p>"Haml":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/haml is a drop-in replacement for embedded ruby templates that has really helped me tame wild and crazy view code (especially on bigger apps). "Sass":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/sass is sorta like Haml's kid brother. It transforms your CSS into something that feels more like Ruby. Cleaner syntax, dynamic variables and logic, auto-nesting. All good stuff.</p>

<p>If you've been on the fence about Haml, check out this talk.</p>
