<div id="post">
<p>While working on a <a href="http://chumby.com/developers/flash">Flash developers page</a> for the Chumby website, I kept getting this error:</p>

<p>&lt;macro:code lang=”ruby”>
Error in DevelopersController#flash</p>

<p>You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!
The error occured while evaluating nil.sweep
&lt;/macro:code></p>

<p>Pretty puzzling at first. The method was empty, so what could be wrong here?</p>

<p>&lt;filter:jscode lang="ruby">
class DevelopersController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<p>  def flash
  end</p>

<p>end
&lt;/filter:jscode></p>

<p>Eventually... it hit me! ActionController has its own <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash.html">flash method</a> which is used to display flash notices and warnings.</p>

<p>But, in this case, I was making a page about Adobe Flash, so I was running over a reserved word for controller method names. Kinda obvious, once you think about it.</p>


<p>What's the workaround? Well... if you really need your page to be named "flash" (and I did), just remove the method from your controller. As long as you have a template named flash.rhtml, the page will still load.</p>
