<h1>Don't use flash for a controller method name</h1>

<div id="post">
<p>While working on a <a href="http://chumby.com/developers/flash">Flash developers page</a> for the Chumby website, I kept getting this error:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Error</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="no">DevelopersController</span><span class="c1">#flash</span>

<span class="no">You</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="kp">nil</span> <span class="n">object</span> <span class="k">when</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">didn</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">expect</span> <span class="n">it!</span>
<span class="no">The</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="n">occured</span> <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">evaluating</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sweep</span>
</pre>
</div>


<p>Pretty puzzling at first. The method was empty, so what could be wrong here?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DevelopersController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">flash</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>


<p>Eventually... it hit me! ActionController has its own <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash.html">flash method</a> which is used to display flash notices and warnings.</p>

<p>But, in this case, I was making a page about Adobe Flash, so I was running over a reserved word for controller method names. Kinda obvious, once you think about it.</p>


<p>What's the workaround? Well... if you really need your page to be named "flash" (and I did), just remove the method from your controller. As long as you have a template named flash.rhtml, the page will still load.</p>
